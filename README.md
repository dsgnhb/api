REST API written in node.js using express and mysq

This API is primarily intended for intern usage.

## API Docs
The generated API Documentation is stored in the `dist/docs.html` folder after building, or accessible via the route `/docs`

## Build system

Several gulp tasks are provided, which are described by running `gulp help`:

- typescript linting/compiling tasks (watch/watchAndServe/lint/tdd)
- server application + autorestart it when code changes (through [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon))

## Installation

- Node must be installed on the system
- Run `npm install` from the root folder to install all required dev/build dependencies

## Developing

- Use the `gulp watchAndServe` task 
during development to get hot code-reloading/test running when you modify your code

## Running production server:
### Do not forget renaming the file `.env.example` located in `src` folder to `.env` and insert your data correctly.
To make use of all your server resources, it is recommended to run the server in cluster mode (via the [PM2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2) package)

Use the `gulp serveCluster` task. You can monitor the cluster and issue commands by running pm2 command (for this you might want to install pm2 globally, `npm install pm2 -g`)

## Committing

This project uses [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) for all commit messages:

Gitmoji is an initiative to standardize and explain the use of emojis on GitHub commit messages. Using emojis on commit messages provides an easy way of identifying the purpose or intention of a commit.
